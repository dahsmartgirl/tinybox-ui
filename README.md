# tinybox-ui

> I know Tinybox didn’t ask for a UI. I built one anyway.

No login. No cloud garbage. No fluff. Just raw, local power.  
This is setup. Power limits. Chat. Confidence feedback.  
Built like code. Looks like control.

---

### Why?

Tinybox is raw compute. Ruthless. Minimal. Just how it should be.  
But that doesn’t mean you can’t *see* it move.

I built this UI not as a layer *on top* of Tinybox, but *alongside* it—  
the same way you build a CLI that obeys the machine.
 
Fast. Clean. Local. Done.
