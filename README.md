# tinybox-ui

> tinybox said “no ui.”  
> i said “watch me.”

no login. no cloud garbage. no fluff.  
just raw, local power.

setup. chat. power limits. confidence feedback.  
built like code. looks like control.

## why i designed it

tinybox is compute as it should be — ruthless, local, hacker-first.  
but even the best machines deserve an interface that *respects the machine*.

not a dashboard. not a frontend.  
more like a shell — visual, fast, silent until needed.

this isn’t a “layer on top.”  
it’s a reflection. a ui that *moves like the hardware*.

## features

- **setup flow** – set your power limit and go. no clutter.  
- **confidence feedback** – visualizes the system’s internal “self-trust” in real time.  
- **terminal-style chat** – natural. minimal. feels like code.  
- **live system stats** – temp. usage. performance. at a glance.  
- **local-first respect** – no cloud. no login. no tracking. just you and the metal.

duplicate. remix. build. break. rethink it.

## more coming

this is v0.0001.  
i’m designing for the kind of local-first future we don’t talk enough about.  
no bloated software. no telemetry. no middlemen.  

just smart design that respects the system.
